```
2D fighting game character sprite sheet, hand-drawn anime-style cel shading with clean dark outlines, vivid but natural colors, in the style of a modern hand-drawn arcade fighting game. Landscape image, aspect ratio 4:3.
Exactly 12 poses arranged in an invisible grid of 4 columns and 3 rows. Every cell has the same size. One full-body figure centered in each cell with clear empty space around it. No figure touches another figure or the image border. Nothing is cut off.
The character always faces RIGHT, unless a cell says otherwise.
Same character, same costume, same face, same proportions and same size in every cell. In each row, the feet of every grounded pose rest on the same invisible baseline near the bottom of the row.
IMPORTANT SPACING: each figure is only about 70% of the height of its row, never taller. Leave an empty band of plain background at least 8% of the image height between rows, above the top row and below the bottom row. Hair, fists, fingers, toes and feet NEVER touch the image border or the next row. Feet are never cut off: both feet and all toes are always fully visible.
In every standing and walking pose at least one foot is flat on the baseline: walking is a step, never a hop. Only jump, air and knockdown poses leave the ground.
Background: one single flat solid color (given in the character description) filling the whole image. No gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no cast shadow, no vignette.
Absolutely NO text, letters, numbers, labels, arrows, grid lines, borders or frames.
NO visual effects of any kind: no glow, aura, energy, fire, lightning, sparks, speed lines, motion trails, smears, dust, impact stars or blur.
Only this one character. No opponent, no other people, no props unless a cell says so.

CHARACTER — MIN-JI: young Korean woman, taekwondo champion, about 22 years old, athletic and slim. Long straight black hair in a high ponytail tied with a red ribbon bow. Determined bright dark eyes, friendly face. White V-neck taekwondo dobok with black collar trim, black belt tied at the front, red fingerless sparring gloves, barefoot. Fighting stance: side-on, light on the balls of her feet, hands in a loose guard, ready to kick. Match the attached reference image exactly. Background color: solid flat pure green #00FF00.

SHEET 1 — BASE.
Row 1: four frames of an idle breathing loop in the character's fighting stance: (1) neutral, (2) chest slightly raised, (3) chest fully raised, shoulders up a little, (4) chest coming down. Feet do not move between these four frames.
Row 2: walk cycle forward, frames 1 to 4: (1) front foot reaching forward, (2) weight passing over front foot, (3) back foot passing, (4) back foot planting. Guard stays up. At least one foot flat on the baseline in every frame: small walking steps, never jumping.
Row 3: walk cycle forward, frames 5 to 8: same motion with the other leg, ending one step before frame 1, so the 8 frames loop smoothly. At least one foot flat on the baseline in every frame.
```

### Prompt 3 — folha 2 — movimento e reações

**JÁ GERADA** (Runway, 2026-10-20): `min-ji-f2-reacoes-v1.png` e `-v2` (a v2 é a v1 com o nocaute espelhado por código) em `arte-fonte/`. Não gere de novo; o estado de aprovação está no `PROGRESSO.md`.

- **Anexar:** `min-ji-mestra-v1.png` (a aprovada; só esta imagem, nunca duas: com duas, o modelo devolve uma delas. Se o estilo ou a escala variarem, troque pela `min-ji-f1-base` aprovada, também sozinha)
- **Salvar como:** `min-ji-f2-reacoes-v1.png`
- **Checagem rápida:** linha 3: os golpes recebidos jogam o corpo para a ESQUERDA, e no nocaute a cabeça fica à ESQUERDA. Se o nocaute vier com a cabeça à direita, não gere de novo nem corrija pelo gerador: o Atlas espelha só essa figura por código e salva como `-v2`.

## Prompts de correção (já com o traje e o fundo deste lutador)

No Runway, passe **só a imagem com defeito** como referência (uma imagem por prompt). **Um defeito por vez.** Onde aparecer
`[R]` e `[C]`, troque pelo número da linha e da coluna da figura com problema, contando de 1 a partir do canto superior esquerdo.

**Nocaute com a cabeça à direita, ou figura que só precisa ser espelhada ou movida: não use prompt.** A edição pontual no
Runway ignora a instrução e cria artefatos (cabeça fantasma na MIN-JI). O Atlas espelha a figura por código e salva como versão nova.

#### Correção 1 — Fundo com degradê, chão ou sombra

```
Edit this image: replace the entire background with one perfectly flat solid #00FF00 color. Remove any floor, ground shadow, cast shadow, gradient or vignette. Do not change the figures.
```

#### Correção 2 — Fundo xadrez ("transparente")

```
Edit this image: the background must be one flat solid #00FF00 color, not a transparency checkerboard. Do not change the figures.
```

#### Correção 3 — Efeitos desenhados (brilho, fogo, raio, rastro)

```
Edit this image: remove every visual effect (glow, aura, energy, fire, lightning, sparks, speed lines, motion trails, dust, impact marks). Fill those areas with the flat #00FF00 background. Keep the poses and the character exactly the same.
```

#### Correção 4 — Texto, números, linhas de grade, molduras

```
Edit this image: remove all text, numbers, labels, grid lines, borders and frames. Keep everything else exactly the same.
```

#### Correção 5 — Uma figura virada para a esquerda

```
Edit this image: redraw only the figure in row [R], column [C] so it faces RIGHT, same pose, same size, same position. Do not change the other figures.
```

#### Correção 6 — Tamanhos diferentes entre as figuras

```
Edit this image: make every standing figure the same height as the figure in row 1, column 1, and put the feet of every grounded pose on the same baseline in each row. Do not change the poses.
```

#### Correção 7 — Traje mudou numa célula

```
Edit this image: in row [R], column [C], fix the costume to match the attached reference image exactly: red ribbon bow on the high ponytail, black collar trim on the white dobok, red fingerless sparring gloves. Do not change the pose.
```

#### Correção 8 — Figuras encostando ou cortadas na borda

```
Generate again with more spacing. IMPORTANT SPACING: each figure is only about 70% of the height of its row, with an empty band of plain background at least 8% of the image height between rows and along the top and bottom edges. Feet and toes are never cut off and never touch the image border; no figure touches another.
```

#### Correção 9 — Desenhou um adversário (em agarrões)

```
Edit this image: remove the second person. Show only the main character performing the move against empty space, same pose.
```

#### Correção 10 — Número errado de figuras

```
Generate again: exactly 12 figures in 4 columns and 3 rows, one per cell.
```

#### Correção 11 — Estilo virou 3D ou foto

```
Keep exactly the same 2D hand-drawn cel-shaded anime style as the attached reference image. Not 3D, not a photo, not painterly.
```

#### Correção 12 — Mãos ou membros deformados

```
Edit this image: fix the hands in row [R], column [C]: five fingers, natural anatomy, same pose.
```

Se uma edição mudar a imagem inteira (rosto novo, poses novas), descarte o resultado e volte à versão anterior.
